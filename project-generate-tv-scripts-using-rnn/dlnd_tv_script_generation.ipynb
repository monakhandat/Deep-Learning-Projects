The learning rate of 0.0001 worked perfectly for me as in there was less fluctuating loss values for 0.0001 learning rate as can be seen from loss values above. The more hidden_dim the better would be the result according to the tutorial videos, so I went from 50 hidden_dim to 500. Between 1-3 n_layers are recommended for RNNs, so chose three n_layers to be on safer side. "
